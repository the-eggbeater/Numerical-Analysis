# Numerical-Analysis
This repository contains the code numerically solving the basic problems in Numerical Analysis for Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer problems.
The code has been built on the basis of the Finite Difference Method to discretise the governing equations. The 3 problems solved mainly are:
i. 1D Convection-Diffusion Problem
ii. 2D Pure-Diffusion Problem
iii. 2D Lid Driven Cavity flow Problem
